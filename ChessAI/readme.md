# Introduction
This project will consist of the implementation of a decent chess playing agent. For This will be done by implementing an AI that plays chess in the best possible way following the adversarial search paradigm and using **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta pruning**.

The search space is a chessboard of 8x8 squares. Within this chessboard, our agent must analyse the situation of the board, which pieces it has, which pieces it has, which pieces it has, which pieces it has.
the situation of the board, what pieces it has, what moves it has available and what that move will be, bearing in mind that the opponent will play that the opponent will play in an optimal way.

Chess is a game of perfect information, which means that both players are aware of the current state of the game at all times. of the current state of the game at all times. This means that, by means of search algorithms, Theoretically, we can pose possible solutions for an agent playing chess. 

However, it isown that in reality, the dimension of the problem is totally impossible to tackle.
